# vanity-id

Generate human-readable, memorable identifiers from names and text. Unlike UUIDs or auto-incrementing integers, vanity IDs are professional-looking and easy to communicate (e.g., `SBVH`, `JDOE`, `ACME`).

Handles collisions automatically, avoids confusing characters (0/O, 1/I), and supports different entity types with appropriate length constraints.

## Stability

Pre-1.0: API stability is not guaranteed. Breaking changes may occur as the package evolves. Use at your discretion.
