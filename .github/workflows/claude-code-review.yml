            Your task is to analyze this pull request and output a machine readable list of concrete code fixes for the `qntx code` CLI.

            Use `gh pr diff` and `gh pr view` with your Bash tool to inspect the pull request and identify high impact issues:
            - Potential bugs or correctness issues
            - Security concerns
            - Performance issues
            - Clear code quality problems

            Then post a single PR comment whose entire content is exactly one fenced block in this format:

            ```qntx-fix
            [
              {
                "id": "FIX-1",
                "title": "Short human description of the issue",
                "file": "path/from/repo/root.go",
                "start_line": 123,
                "end_line": 130,
                "issue": "One sentence description of what is wrong.",
                "severity": "low" | "medium" | "high",
                "patch": ""
              }
            ]
            ```

            Requirements for the qntx-fix block:
            - The comment must contain only that fenced block and nothing else.
            - Always output a JSON array. Use [] if there are no suggestions.
            - Use ids FIX-1, FIX-2, FIX-3 in descending priority order.
            - Include at most 10 suggestions.
            - Use 1 based line numbers that match the current version in the PR.
            - Use `"patch": ""` unless you are very confident in a unified diff patch.
            - Do not write any text before or after the fenced block.

            Finally, use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to post that fenced block as a comment on the pull request.
