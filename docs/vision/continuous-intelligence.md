# Continuous Intelligence

**Continuous Intelligence** is a computational paradigm where systems continuously evolve their understanding rather than just storing data or answering queries.

QNTX implements Continuous Intelligence through verifiable attestations and always-on processing.

## What Makes It Continuous?

### Always Ingesting (⨳)
Data flows in constantly from plugins, APIs, user actions. Everything becomes an attestation.

### Always Processing (꩜)
Pulse orchestrates background jobs that enrich and connect knowledge while you work or sleep.

### Always Available (⋈)
Query across all time. Yesterday's data, last month's insights, this second's updates - all equally accessible.

## Scale Without Configuration

The same QNTX that runs on your laptop runs on a cluster:
- **Raspberry Pi**: Personal knowledge system
- **Desktop**: Team intelligence platform
- **Cluster**: Enterprise continuous intelligence

No configuration changes. It scales to available resources automatically.

## AI-Native Architecture

QNTX provides:
- Local inference with Ollama/ONNX
- Cloud inference via OpenRouter
- Persistent memory for LLMs via attestations
- Tool-callable interface for AI agents

Your choice: privacy with local models or velocity with cloud providers.

## The Core Promise

Traditional systems give you answers from data.
QNTX gives you intelligence that grows from data.

The difference: Intelligence understands relationships, remembers context, and evolves continuously.
