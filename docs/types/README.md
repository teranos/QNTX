# QNTX Type Definitions

Auto-generated documentation showing Go source code alongside TypeScript type definitions.

> **Purpose**: Provides a single source of truth for type definitions across different contexts (ChatGPT projects, documentation, etc.) to prevent type drift.

## Packages

### Core Types

- **[types](./types.md)** - Core attestation types (As, AsCommand, AxFilter) (11 types)
- **[sym](./sym.md)** - QNTX symbol constants and collections (0 types)

### Pulse System

- **[async](./async.md)** - Asynchronous job processing with Pulse (9 types)
- **[budget](./budget.md)** - Cost tracking and budget management (4 types)
- **[schedule](./schedule.md)** - Scheduled execution with cron (1 types)

### Server

- **[server](./server.md)** - WebSocket message types for real-time updates (43 types)

## Usage

### For LLM Contexts (ChatGPT, Claude Projects)

Copy the relevant markdown file into your project context to ensure type consistency:

```
Project Files/
  └── qntx-types.md  (copy from docs/types/)
```

### For Development

Use as reference when:
- Writing TypeScript code that interfaces with QNTX
- Understanding the shape of API responses
- Debugging type mismatches

### For Documentation

Link to specific types in your docs:
```markdown
See [Job type](./docs/types/async.md#job) for details.
```

## Regeneration

These files are automatically regenerated from Go source code:

```bash
make types              # Regenerate all types
make types-check        # Verify types are up to date (CI)
```

**Do not edit manually** - changes will be overwritten.

## Format

Each type is shown side-by-side:

| Go Source | TypeScript |
|-----------|------------|
| Full struct with tags | Generated interface |

This makes it easy to:
- See the canonical Go definition
- Understand the TypeScript mapping
- Verify struct tags are correct
- Cross-reference between languages
