# ADR-048: Agents

Date: 2026-10-04
Status: Proposed

QNTX hosts agents.

"an agent is itself"

- In A2A's terms QNTX is the A2A Server: the endpoint, authentication and
  authorization are the node's. Each agent it hosts is a card, reached by its
  tenant (AgentInterface.tenant).
- An agent has its own DID and attests as itself: `by` on what it writes is
  the agent.
- What an agent may reach is its own lines in system, as any actor's are.
- An agent's work outlives the request that brought it, and every call it
  makes carries its own credential. The credential of whoever sent the work
  never reaches what the agent calls (ADR-038).
- A Task has two actors: who sent it, and the agent doing it. Who may see the
  Task is the sender's admission; what the agent touches is the agent's.
- An agent stands in a namespace, and nothing crosses (ADR-026).
- To A2A an agent is a card, and its skills are the signa it reaches
  (ADR-039).

## The host agent

"the host agent is QNTX as ROOT would talk to it."

"It is the ROOT agent, one persistent session agent that is QNTX itself as
expressed to ROOT."

## The loop

"loop belongs on node, agreed."

- The loop that calls the model and runs what it asks for is the node's. A
  provider plugin does inference and nothing else (ADR-014).

## First uses

- A ritual's performer, in place of `claude --bg` (teranos/ground RITUAL.md).
- A2A: work sent to an agent the node hosts.
