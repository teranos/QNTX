# ADR-048: Agents

Date: 2026-10-04
Status: Proposed

QNTX hosts agents.

"an agent is itself"

- An agent has its own DID and attests as itself: `by` on what it writes is
  the agent.
- What an agent may reach is its own lines in system, as any actor's are.
- An agent's work outlives the request that brought it, and every call it
  makes carries its own credential. The credential of whoever sent the work
  never reaches what the agent calls (ADR-038).
- A Task has two actors: who sent it, and the agent doing it. Who may see the
  Task is the sender's admission; what the agent touches is the agent's.
- An agent stands in a namespace, and nothing crosses (ADR-026).
- To A2A an agent is a card, and its skills are the signa it reaches
  (ADR-039).
