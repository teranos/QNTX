# Pulse

The pulsing heartbeat of QNTX - what makes intelligence continuous.

## Why Pulse?

Intelligence isn't one-off queries. Real systems need **continuous background work**: ingesting data, processing updates, enriching entities, running scheduled analysis.

Without centralized control, this never ends. You add another cron job, another scheduler, another ad-hoc background task - until you have chaos.

**Pulse is the answer**: A single place to reason about continuous compute, system resources, and priorities. It ensures you stay within API limits, don't overspend, and schedule work intelligently.
