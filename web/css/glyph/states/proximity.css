/**
 * Glyph Proximity State - Expanded with text
 *
 * When mouse approaches, glyphs expand to show their title/label.
 * Width ranges from 8px (dot) to 220px (fully expanded).
 *
 * Note: Most proximity styling happens via JavaScript for smooth
 * continuous morphing based on mouse distance. These classes
 * define the structural requirements for text display.
