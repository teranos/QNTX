**QNTX** = A modular Continuous Intelligence Platform operated as a graph of attestations. It automates data ingestion, enrichment, and reasoning to create a continuously self-improving knowledge graph.

```
Data → Graph → Knowledge → Intelligence → Action

## What is QNTX?

QNTX provides a **domain-agnostic foundation** for building knowledge systems. At its core is the **[Attestation Type System (ATS)](ats/README.md)**

## Segments

- **≡** am - system (being/state)
- **⌬** of - actors/agents
- **⨳** ix - ingest
- **⋈** ax - ask/query

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
go test ./...
```
